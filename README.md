# File-encryption
This is an encryption tool that uses the AES256 cipher to encrypt your text files.

## How to use
You can use the tool by selecting  a file then pressing the encryption button. If you want to decrypt the file just press "decrypt" however, if you want to decrypt it at a later date or want to send to another person, press the "save config" button. This should create a config with all the needed parameters needed to decrypt the file this file should be located in your execution directory (of the jar file).

Currently, manually entering the values except the password does not work because it is not implemented yet but will be in the future.
