# this is an Encription Tool that uses AES256 Encription to encript your text files :

it works by opening a file then pressing the encription button
if you want to Decript the file just press decrpit but if want to eather decript it at a later date or want to send to another person press the save config button
this should create a config with all the needed parameters needed to decript the file this file shoudl be located in you execution direcory(of the jar file)

currently manually entering the values exept the password does not work because I haven't implemnted it yet but I will do so in the future so stay tuned for that.
